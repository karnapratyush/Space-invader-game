# SPACE INVADERS

Creating a game of space invaders using pygame. The idea is inspired by the following youtube video from Free code camp
[FreeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfWpgLFMI7w&t=1780s&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org)

The aim of this project is to get used to github as well as share my learnings about pygame.
